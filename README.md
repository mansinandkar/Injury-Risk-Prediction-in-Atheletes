# Injury-Risk-Prediction-in-Atheletes

Athlete injuries pose significant physical and psychological challenges, impacting both team perfor-
mance and individual careers. With the increasing availability of data from wearable sensors, IoT
devices, and physiological monitoring systems, a variety of data-driven approaches have emerged to
predict injuries and improve athlete safety. This study presents a comparative analysis of established
machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques for predicting injury risk in athletes. It
focuses on implementing and evaluating these models to assess their performance, interpretability,
and applicability in real-world sports scenarios, with particular emphasis on prediction accuracy and
response time. By benchmarking these techniques, we aim to highlight their strengths, limitations,
and practical relevance, offering insights for future research and deployments in sports analytics.
