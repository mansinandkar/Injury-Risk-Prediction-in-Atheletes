# Injury-Risk-Prediction-in-Atheletes

Athlete injuries pose significant physical and psychological challenges, impacting both team performance and individual careers. With the increasing availability of data from wearable sensors, IoT
devices, and physiological monitoring systems, a variety of data-driven approaches have emerged to predict injuries and improve athlete safety. This study presents a comparative analysis of established
machine learning (ML) such as Random Forest, LogReg, and Support Vector Machine, and deep learning (DL) like 1D CNN and LSTM, for predicting injury risk in athletes. 
It focuses on implementing and evaluating these models to assess their performance, interpretability, and applicability in real-world sports scenarios, particularly on prediction accuracy and
response time. By benchmarking these techniques, we aim to highlight their strengths, limitations, and practical relevance, offering insights for future research and deployments in sports analytics.
